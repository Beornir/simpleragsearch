# Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

**Effective Date:** September 1, 2024
**Last Updated:** September 1, 2024
**Department:** Human Resources
**Status:** Active

## Overview

Meridian Technologies provides a flexible PTO policy to support work-life balance. This policy replaces the previous PTO policy dated January 2023.

## PTO Allowances

| Level | Annual PTO Days | Carryover Limit |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| IC1-IC3 (Junior/Mid) | 20 days | 5 days |
| IC4-IC5 (Senior/Staff) | 25 days | 10 days |
| M1-M3 (Managers) | 25 days | 10 days |
| Directors+ | Flexible/Unlimited | N/A |

## Key Changes from Previous Policy

- **Carryover increased**: Previously 3 days for IC1-IC3, now 5 days.
- **Director+ moved to unlimited**: Previously capped at 30 days.
- **Minimum usage requirement**: All employees must take at least 10 days per year. Managers are required to ensure their reports meet this minimum.

## Request Process

1. Submit PTO requests through **Workday** (not BambooHR — we migrated in July 2024).
2. Requests of 3+ consecutive days require **5 business days notice**.
3. Requests during blackout periods (see Section 5) require VP approval.

## Blackout Periods

- **Q4 Code Freeze**: December 15 - January 2 (engineering only)
- **Annual Planning**: Last two weeks of March (directors+ only)

## Sick Leave

Sick leave is separate from PTO. Employees receive **10 sick days per year**, non-carryover. For absences exceeding 3 consecutive days, a doctor's note must be submitted to HR within 48 hours of return.

## Parental Leave

Meridian offers **16 weeks paid parental leave** for all new parents, regardless of gender. This can be taken within 12 months of the child's birth or adoption date. Parental leave does not count against PTO.
